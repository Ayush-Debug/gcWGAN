In our project we used "astral-scopedom-seqres-gd-sel-gs-bib-100-2.07.fa", where the sequences that are totally the same have been deleted and only one of them were left.
"astral-scopedom-seqres-gd-all-2.07-stable.all" is too big to upload. Here is the link: home/shaowen1994/Research/Protein_Inverse_Design/Data_Process/Original_Data/astral-scopedom-seqres-gd-all-2.07-stable.fa
