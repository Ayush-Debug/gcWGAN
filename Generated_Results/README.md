# Generated Results

## Sequence Samples:

* **For_Diversity_and_Novelty:** Contain the generated sequences based on cWGAN and gcWGAN that we applied for sequence diversity and novelty analysis.
* **For_Generating_Ratio_Analysis:** Contain the generated sequences based on cWGAN and gcWGAN that we applied for generating rate analysis.
* **For_Rosetta_Analysis:** Contain the generated sequences based on gcWGAN that we applied for Rosetta analysis.

## Predictions_from_Rosetta

Contain the final structure predictions we selected by applying Rosetta software and its default clustering algorithm.
