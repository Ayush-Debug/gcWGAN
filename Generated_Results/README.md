# Generated Results

## Sequence Samples:

* **For_Diversity_and_Novelty:** Contain the generated sequences based on cWGAN and gcWGAN that we applied for sequence diversity and novelty analysis.
* **For_Generating_Ratio_Analysis:** Contain the generated sequences based on cWGAN and gcWGAN that we applied for generating rate analysis.
* **For_Rosetta_Analysis:** Contain the generated sequences based on gcWGAN that we applied for Rosetta analysis. (For each fold, the 10 sequences are the first 10 sequences in the successful sequence file for sequence diversity and novelty analysis.)

## Predictions_from_Rosetta

* **Rosetta_Clustering:** Contain the final 700 structure predictions (10 for each sequence, 100 for each fold) we selected by applying Rosetta software and its default clustering algorithm.
* **Spectral_Clustering:** Contain the final 700 structure predictions (10 for each sequence, 100 for each fold) we selected by applying Rosetta software and spectral clustering algorithm based on RMSD matrix.
