# Model Accuracy:

## Yield Ratio:
Yield ratio reflects the portion of the sequences that pass the oracle, which can reflect the model accuracy. For comparison we also applied the previous state-of-art model, [cVAE](https://github.com/psipred/protein-vae) to calculate the yield ratios. To calculate the yield ratio, go to the ***Yield_Ratio_Analysis*** folder and follow the instructions.
