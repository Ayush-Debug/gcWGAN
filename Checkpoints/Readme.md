# Check Points

This folder contains the links to download our trained model weights. By loading such weights we can applied our model to generate sequences acording to given target folds.

## Train the Model (For *cWGAN* and *gcWGAN*)
To train the model, directly go to the folder ***cWGAN*** or ***gcWGAN*** and follow the instructions.

## Load the Trained Model
Download the check points you need in the related folder. You can download all of check points to apply our model with the link below to replace the folders and  files inside this folder.

* **WarmStart/Unlabeled_Training/:** 

Check point after applyting unlabeled data to pre-train the model. With this check point you can then apply the labeled data and begin the semi-supervised learning.
